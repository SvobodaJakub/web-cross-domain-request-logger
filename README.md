Scripts in this repo

* assemble batches of domains to go through from sources of top N domains
* create firejail sandboxes
* automatically open the batched domains in chromium in the sandboxes
* for each visited 1st-party domain record the requested 3rd party domains
* analyze the data and assemble a blacklist of probable tracking domains


Disclaimers:

* Experimental.
* Use at your own risk.
* Identification of a domain by these tools doesn't imply or correlate with the domain's real conduct or policies. Take the results with a grain of salt.
* Presence or absence of a domain in the generated list or in the whitelist doesn't imply or correlate with the domain's real conduct or policies and is merely a result of experimentation with the tooling.
